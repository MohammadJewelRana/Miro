## ðŸš€ About Project
 This is a frontened project which is designed by using react. This project is fully responsive. In navbar ,when it is small device its show another design some field will be hidden and in medium or large device its show on navbar.

 I am using flexbox and grid .Also i am using react router to navigate the route. Also i added context api. It has a home page layout and navbar, footer are there but body is changing through outlet(react  router feature).i Also uses react icon.hero icon. SOmetimes, i created data and kept in public file where i need i just fetch the data using useState,useEffect,react query etc.I also uses parallax which is very beautiful.Lastly i added some animation using React AOS.

 Sometimes i created a shared component and pass the data or other things to that component for reusing same component which gives page performance faster.

 In two section i uses react query for fetching the data and by using the data i show all the button and its also multi functional when button cliecked that particular data is showing on the inerface. As i used sahred componenet i passes status. If status will be true than design slightly modified.

 I added 4 extra things. Two banners ,login and registration page. In login and registration page the data will be get by state management and kept in a function.In registration page, i implement upload image section where by selecting imagae instant show the image in registration page.This all handled by state management.
